### Summary
The data represents the city’s school district data and provides information by the school district and the school. The data includes the name and type of school, the number of students, and the budget. The data also has information about students’ names, gender, grade, reading scores, and math scores. Further, the percentage of students who passed reading, math, and both were calculated district and school-wise. Based on the passing rate, the highest and lowest-performing schools were identified. The average math and reading score were also calculated for all high school grade levels. The data summary was presented after stratifying by school size, spending, and school type. 

Further conclusions were reached after data analyses.
* 15 schools are in a district with a total student headcount of 39,170. The math, reading, and overall pass percentage was 74.98%, 85.81%, and 65.17%, respectively.
* All the top 5 performing schools are Charter schools, with an overall passing percentage above 90%.
* The bottom five performing schools are District schools, with the lowest overall passing percentage of 53.5%.
* There was an indirect relationship between average spending ranges (per student) and the passing percentage for math, reading, and overall. As the spending range increased, the passing percentage decreased. 
* The school size didn’t show a trend or association with the test performance scores of students.
* In summary, charter schools' standardized test scores and passing rates were higher than district ones.
